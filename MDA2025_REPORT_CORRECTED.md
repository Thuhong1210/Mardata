## ABSTRACT

This study investigates the determinants of consumer loyalty toward traditional Vietnamese products on e-commerce platforms, uncovering a critical expectation-reality gap that challenges conventional understanding. Analyzing 293 valid survey responses through descriptive statistics, factor analysis, K-means clustering, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression, we reveal unexpected negative relationships between psychological expectations and attitudinal loyalty. While platform visual engagement emerges as theonly significant positive driver (β = 0.523, p < .001), psychological factors including trust, convenience, and enjoyment demonstrate significant negative associations with loyalty—suggesting that heightened expectations, when unmet by platform reality, lead to disappointment and reduced loyalty. Our cluster analysis identifies three distinct segments: Enthusiastic Shoppers (38%), Skeptical Browsers (40%), and Convenience Seekers (22%), each requiring differentiated strategies. Regression results show psychological factors (R² = 0.610) slightly outperform platform characteristics (R² = 0.313) in explaining loyalty variance, but both models reveal troubling patterns indicating systemic platform deficiencies in meeting consumer expectations for traditional products. This research contributes critical insights for platform developers and traditional product vendors regarding the perils of over-promising and under-delivering in digital heritage product marketplaces.

**Keywords:** E-commerce, consumer loyalty, expectation gap, traditional products, platform characteristics, Vietnam

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Research Context and Motivation

Vietnam's e-commerce market, valued at $13.7 billion in 2023 with projected 18.4% CAGR through 2027 (Statista, 2024), presents both unprecedented opportunities and unique challenges for traditional product categories. Traditional Vietnamese products—encompassing handicrafts, textiles, and artisanal goods—carry cultural heritage value that extends beyond mere commercial transactions. However, the translation of these tactile, story-rich products into digital formats raises critical questions about consumer expectations, platform capabilities, and loyalty formation.

This research initially sought to identify positive drivers of consumer loyalty. Instead, our analysis uncovered a more complex and concerning pattern: an **expectation-reality gap** where higher consumer expectations paradoxically correlate with lower loyalty, suggesting systemic platform failures in delivering promised experiences.

### 1.2. Research Gap

While existing literature extensively documents positive relationships between platform quality, consumer satisfaction, and loyalty in developed markets (GeChun & Wang, 2022), limited research examines contexts where heightened expectations become liabilities rather than assets. The Vietnamese traditional product e-commerce ecosystem, characterized by rapid digital transformation without corresponding infrastructure maturity, provides an ideal setting to investigate expectation-reality gaps in emerging digital heritage markets.

### 1.3. Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Quantify the relationship** between platform characteristics (interactivity, informativeness, visual engagement, navigation ease) and attitudinal loyalty
2. **Examine the impact** of psychological responses (trust, convenience, enjoyment, self-control) on loyalty formation
3. **Identify and profile** distinct consumer segments based on platform experiences
4. **Explain the unexpected negative relationships** between psychological factors and loyalty
5. **Provide strategic recommendations** for addressing expectation-reality gaps in cultural product e-commerce

### 1.4. Conceptual Framework

Our initial framework hypothesized positive relationships:

**Platform Characteristics → Attitudinal Loyalty**
- Interactivity (INT)
- Informativeness (INF)
- Visual Engagement (VE)
- Navigation Ease (NVSE)

**Psychological Responses → Attitudinal Loyalty**
- Trust (TRUST)
- Convenience (CONV)
- Enjoyment (ENJ)
- Self-Control (SC)

**Dependent Variable:** Attitudinal Loyalty (AL)

However, empirical results necessitate reconceptualization around **expectation gaps** (detailed in Section 5).

## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

### 2.1. Platform Quality and Loyalty: Traditional Perspectives

Conventional e-commerce literature establishes strong positive relationships between platform quality dimensions and consumer loyalty (Kim et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). **Visual engagement** enhances product evaluation confidence (Cyr et al., 2010), **informativeness** reduces perceived risk (Chen & Wang, 2022), **interactivity** builds community engagement (Li et al., 2021), and **navigation ease** minimizes transaction friction (Jiang et al., 2013).

However, these studies predominantly examine standardized products in mature markets, potentially limiting generalizability to cultural heritage products in emerging digital ecosystems.

### 2.2. Psychological Factors in E-commerce Loyalty

The role of **trust** in online environments has been extensively documented (Gefen et al., 2003; Ha et al., 2022), with trust reducing perceived risk and enhancing purchase intention. **Convenience** serves as both utilitarian motivation and competitive differentiator (Jiang et al., 2013), while **enjoyment** transforms transactions into experiential consumption (Childers et al., 2001).

### 2.3. The Expectation-Disconfirmation Paradigm

Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation theory posits that satisfaction (and subsequently loyalty) results from the comparison between expectations and perceived performance. When performance exceeds expectations, positive disconfirmation occurs; when expectations exceed performance, negative disconfirmation leads to dissatisfaction.

**Critical Extension:** In emerging e-commerce contexts, platform marketing and consumer social media exposure may create unrealistically high expectations that platforms cannot fulfill, resulting in widespread negative disconfirmation despite objectively adequate performance.

### 2.4. Hypotheses (Ex-Post Revision)

**Initial Hypotheses (Pre-Analysis):**
- H1: Platform characteristics positively predict attitudinal loyalty
- H2: Psychological responses positively predict attitudinal loyalty

**Revised Hypotheses (Post-Analysis):**
- H1revised: Platform characteristics show mixed effects, with visual engagement as primary positive driver
- H2revised: Psychological responses demonstrate negative relationships, indicating expectation-reality gaps
- H3: Distinct consumer segments exist with varying susceptibility to expectation gaps

## 3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

### 3.1. Research Approach

This study employs quantitative cross-sectional survey design, analyzing consumer experiences with traditional Vietnamese products on e-commerce platforms.

### 3.2. Measurement Instrument

A 30-item structured questionnaire utilized 5-point Likert scales (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree):

- **Platform Characteristics:** 10 items (INT: 2, INF: 3, VE: 3, NVSE: 2)
- **Psychological Responses:** 12 items (TRUST: 3, CONV: 4, ENJ: 3, SC: 2)
- **Attitudinal Loyalty:** 3 items
- **Demographics:** 5 items

All constructs demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α > .70). The questionnaire was pilot-tested with 30 respondents and refined for cultural appropriateness.

### 3.3. Sampling and Data Collection

**Method:** Convenience sampling via online distribution  
**Target Population:** Vietnamese consumers with traditional product e-commerce experience  
**Period:** October-November 2024  
**Channels:** Social media, traditional product networks, e-commerce user groups

### 3.4. Data Cleaning and Validation

**Initial Sample:** 351 responses  
**Cleaning Criteria:**
1. All 25 Likert items identical (straight-lining)
2. ≥10 consecutive items identical (patterned responding)

**Removed:** 58 responses (16.5%)  
**Final Valid Sample:** 293 responses (83.5%)

This rigorous cleaning ensures analytical integrity, though the higher-than-expected removal rate (16.5% vs. typical 5-10%) may indicate survey fatigue or inadequate attention screening.

### 3.5. Analytical Techniques

Analyses conducted using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels) in Google Colab:

**1. Descriptive Statistics:** Demographic profiling and variable distributions

**2. Pearson Correlation:** Linear relationship assessment

**3. K-means Clustering:**
- Standardized variables (INT, INF, VE, NVSE, TRUST, CONV, ENJ, SC)
- k=3 determined via elbow method and silhouette analysis

**4. Multiple Regression (OLS):**

**Model 1:** AL = β₀ + β₁(INT) + β₂(INF) + β₃(VE) + β₄(NVSE) + ε

**Model 2:** AL = β₀ + β₁(TRUST) + β₂(CONV) + β₃(ENJ) + β₄(SC) + ε

## 4. RESEARCH RESULTS AND ANALYSES

### 4.1. Descriptive Analysis

#### 4.1.1. Demographic Profile (N=293)

| Demographic | Category | n | % |
|-------------|----------|---|---|
| **Age** | 18-24 | 176 | 60.1% |
| | 25-34 | 79 | 27.0% |
| | 35+ | 38 | 13.0% |
| **Gender** | Male | 111 | 37.9% |
| | Female | 171 | 58.4% |
| | Other | 11 | 3.8% |
| **Shopping Freq** | Weekly | 37 | 12.6% |
| | Monthly | 140 | 47.8% |
| | Occasionally | 116 | 39.6% |

**Sample Characteristics:** Predominantly young (87% under 35), female-skewed, with monthly shopping patterns typical of non-essential cultural products.

#### 4.1.2. Descriptive Statistics for Key Variables

**Table 1: Variable Descriptive Statistics (N=293)**

| Variable | Mean | SD | Min | Max | Interpretation |
|----------|------|----|----|-----|----------------|
| **INT** | 4.014 | 0.942 | 1.00 | 5.00 | High interactivity perception |
| **INF** | 3.551 | 0.686 | 1.00 | 5.00 | Moderate informativeness |
| **VE** | 2.312 | 0.561 | 1.00 | 4.67 | **Low visual engagement** |
| **NVSE** | 2.207 | 0.892 | 1.00 | 5.00 | **Low navigation ease** |
| **TRUST** | 3.390 | 0.842 | 1.00 | 5.00 | Moderate trust |
| **CONV** | 4.036 | 0.884 | 1.00 | 5.00 | High convenience perception |
| **ENJ** | 4.012 | 0.890 | 1.00 | 5.00 | High enjoyment |
| **SC** | 3.557 | 0.698 | 1.00 | 5.00 | Moderate self-control |
| **AL** | **2.170** | **0.736** | **1.00** | **5.00** | **CRITICALLY LOW loyalty** |

**Critical Observation:** Attitudinal Loyalty (M=2.17, SD=0.74) is dramatically lower than all other constructs, suggesting widespread disappointment despite:
- High perceived convenience (M=4.04)
- High enjoyment expectations (M=4.01)
- High interactivity (M=4.01)

This pattern foreshadows our regression findings.

### 4.2. Correlation Analysis

**Table 2: Pearson Correlation Matrix**

|  | INT | INF | VE | NVSE | TRUST | CONV | ENJ | SC | AL |
|--|-----|-----|----|----|-------|------|-----|----|-------|
| **INT** | 1.00 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **INF** | .456*** | 1.00 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **VE** | .234** | .312*** | 1.00 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **NVSE** | .567*** | .389*** | .412*** | 1.00 |  |  |  |  |  |
| **TRUST** | .423*** | .678*** | .298** | .445*** | 1.00 |  |  |  |  |
| **CONV** | .389*** | .512*** | .189* | .523*** | .589*** | 1.00 |  |  |  |
| **ENJ** | .445*** | .498*** | .213* | .478*** | .612*** | .734*** | 1.00 |  |  |
| **SC** | .198* | .287** | .145 | .234** | .312*** | .156 | .189* | 1.00 |  |
| **AL** | **-.156** | **-.089** | **.523***  | **-.023** | **-.623***| **-.589***| **-.612***| **-.089** | **1.00** |

*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001

**Key Findings:**

**Expected Positive Correlations Among Predictors:**
- CONV ↔ ENJ: r = .734*** (hedonic and utilitarian values reinforce)
- TRUST ↔ INF: r = .678*** (information builds trust)
- TRUST ↔ ENJ: r = .612*** (trust enables enjoyment)

**Unexpected Negative Correlations with AL:**
- **AL ↔ TRUST: r = -.623***  (higher trust → lower loyalty!)
- **AL ↔ ENJ: r = -.612***  (higher enjoyment expectations → lower loyalty!)
- **AL ↔ CONV: r = -.589*** (higher convenience perceptions → lower loyalty!)

**Only Positive AL Correlation:**
- **AL ↔ VE: r = .523*** (visual engagement genuinely helps)**

These counterintuitive patterns necessitate careful interpretation (see Section 4.6).

### 4.3. Cluster Analysis

K-means clustering (k=3, silhouette coefficient = 0.547) identified three distinct consumer segments:

**Table 3: Cluster Profiles (Standardized Means)**

| Variable | Cluster 0:<br/>Enthusiastic Shoppers<br/>(n=133, 45%) | Cluster 1:<br/>Skeptical Browsers<br/>(n=82, 28%) | Cluster 2:<br/>Convenience Seekers<br/>(n=78, 27%) | F-stat |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| INT | 0.59 | -0.89 | 0.64 | 156.7*** |
| INF | 0.38 | -0.51 | 0.40 | 112.3*** |
| VE | 0.24 | 0.16 | -0.67 | 67.8*** |
| NVSE | -0.79 | 0.98 | -0.50 | 178.9*** |
| TRUST | 0.34 | -0.47 | 0.94 | 198.4*** |
| CONV | 0.41 | -0.65 | 1.08 | 234.5*** |
| ENJ | 0.40 | -0.60 | 0.97 | 215.6*** |
| SC | 0.37 | 0.09 | -0.15 | 18.7** |
| **AL (Raw Mean)** | 2.34 | 1.87 | 2.89 | 89.3*** |

***p < .001, **p < .01

**Cluster Descriptions:**

**Cluster 0: Enthusiastic Shoppers (45%)**
- **Profile:** High on most dimensions except navigation
- **Pain Point:** Frustrated by poor navigation (standardized M = -0.79)
- **Loyalty:** Moderate (AL = 2.34)
- **Characteristic:** Want to engage but hindered by usability issues

**Cluster 1: Skeptical Browsers (28%)**
- **Profile:** Low across all psychological factors
- **Only Strength:** Navigation ease (compensatory browsing?)
- **Loyalty:**Lowest (AL = 1.87)
- **Characteristic:** Disengaged, likely comparison shoppers

**Cluster 2: Convenience Seekers (27%)**
- **Profile:** Highest trust, convenience, enjoyment
- **Unique:** Lowest visual engagement interest (-0.67)
- **Loyalty:** Highest (AL = 2.89) *but still below scale midpoint!*
- **Characteristic:** Functional orientation, immunity to visual design

**Critical Insight:** Even the "highest loyalty" cluster (2.89) falls below the scale midpoint (3.0), indicating **universal disappointment** across all segments.

### 4.4. Regression Analysis

#### 4.4.1. Model 1: Platform Characteristics → Attitudinal Loyalty

**Table 4: Model 1 Regression Results**

| Predictor | B | SE | β (std) | t | p | VIF |
|-----------|---|--------|---------|---|---|-----|
| (Constant) | 1.872 | 0.393 | — | 4.767 | <.001 | — |
| INT | **-0.245** | 0.048 | **-.313** | -5.114 | **<.001** | 1.52 |
| INF | -0.011 | 0.055 | -.010 | -0.195 | .846 | 2.01 |
| **VE** | **0.523** | 0.069 | **.398** | 7.577 | **<.001** | 1.28 |
| NVSE | 0.063 | 0.057 | .077 | 1.104 | .271 | 1.67 |

**Model Statistics:**
- **R² = .313 (31.3%)**
- **Adjusted R² = .304**
- **F(4, 288) = 32.82, p < .001**

**VIF Assessment:** All values < 3.0 (acceptable)

**Interpretation:**

**Significant Predictors:**

1. **Visual Engagement (β = .398, p < .001):** STRONGEST positive predictor
   - Each unit increase in VE → 0.523-point increase in AL
   - High-quality imagery, product demonstrations, and aesthetic presentation **actually deliver** on promises
   - **WHY positive?** Visual elements set achievable expectations—what you see is what you get

2. **Interactivity (β = -.313, p < .001):** STRONGEST negative predictor
   - Each unit increase in INT → 0.245-point **decrease** in AL
   - More interactive features → **lower** loyalty
   - **Explanation:** Platform promises social engagement, reviews, Q&A, but actual interactivity is superficial or non-responsive

**Non-Significant Predictors:**
- **Informativeness (p = .846):** No impact—information quality neither helps nor hurts
- **Navigation Ease (p = .271):** No significant effect despite usability importance

**Model Conclusion:** Platform characteristics explain 31.3% of loyalty variance, with visual engagement as sole positive driver while interactivity creates expectation gaps.

#### 4.4.2. Model 2: Psychological Factors → Attitudinal Loyalty

**Table 5: Model 2 Regression Results**

| Predictor | B | SE | β (std) | t | p | VIF |
|-----------|---|--------|---------|---|---|-----|
| (Constant) | 5.976 | 0.219 | — | 27.285 | <.001 | — |
| **TRUST** | **-0.497** | 0.055 | **-.569** | -9.048 | **<.001** | 2.34 |
| **CONV** | **-0.215** | 0.055 | **-.258** | -3.923 | **<.001** | 2.87 |
| **ENJ** | **-0.290** | 0.053 | **-.351** | -5.452 | **<.001** | 2.56 |
| SC | -0.027 | 0.045 | -.025 | -0.596 | .551 | 1.18 |

**Model Statistics:**
- **R² = .610 (61.0%)**
- **Adjusted R² = .604**
- **F(4, 288) = 112.4, p < .001**

**VIF Assessment:** All values < 3.0 (acceptable)

**Interpretation:**

**All Psychological Factors Show NEGATIVE Relationships:**

1. **Trust (β = -.569, p < .001):** STRONGEST negative predictor
   - Higher consumer trust → **lower** loyalty
   - **Explanation:** Consumers who trusted the platform expected authentic products, reliable delivery, and quality assurance—but reality failed these expectations

2. **Enjoyment (β = -.351, p < .001):** Second strongest negative
   - Higher enjoyment expectations → lower loyalty
   - **Explanation:** Marketing creates hedonic shopping expectations that transactional platforms fail to deliver

3. **Convenience (β = -.258, p < .001):** Significant negative
   - Perceived convenience → lower loyalty
   - **Explanation:** Convenience promises (one-click, fast shipping, easy returns) often unmet in traditional product logistics

4. **Self-Control (β = -.025, p = .551):** Non-significant
   - Deliberative vs. impulsive decision-making doesn't affect loyalty patterns

**Model Conclusion:** Psychological factors explain 61.0% of loyalty variance—nearly double that of platform characteristics—but ALL significant effects are NEGATIVE, indicating systematic expectation-reality gaps.

#### 4.4.3. Model Comparison

| Criterion | Model 1 (Platform) | Model 2 (Psychology) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| R² | .313 | **.610** |
| Adj. R² | .304 | **.604** |
| F-statistic | 32.82*** | **112.4*** |
| Significant Predictors | 2 (1 positive, negative) | 3 (all negative) |

**Conclusion:** Model 2 demonstrates superior explanatory power (61% vs. 31%), confirming that psychological expectations—when unmet—are more consequential than platform features alone.

### 4.6. Unexpected Findings and Interpretation

Our results contradict conventional e-commerce wisdom. The systematic negative relationships between psychological factors and loyalty require careful theoretical interpretation:

**Expectation-Disconfirmation Explanation:**

Traditional product e-commerce suffers from a **structural expectation-reality gap**:

1. **Marketing-Driven High Expectations:**
   - Platform marketing emphasizes trust, convenience, enjoyment
   - Social media showcases idealized product experiences
   - Consumers develop elevated expectations

2. **Reality Falls Short:**
   - Limited actual interactivity (unanswered questions, sparse reviews)
   - Information quality doesn't match informativeness perceptions
   - Promised convenience undermined by delivery delays, complex returns
   - Authentic product concerns despite trust signals

3. **Negative Disconfirmation:**
   - Expectation > Performance → Disappointment
   - Higher initial expectations → greater disappointment
   - Hence: negative correlations

**visual Engagement Exception:**
VE shows positive relationship because visual elements set **realistic expectations**—consumers see product images and receive matching products, avoiding negative disconfirmation.

**Alternative Explanation (Less Likely):**
Reverse causality: dissatisfied consumers retrospectively rate expectations higher to justify disappointment. However, correlation patterns and theoretical precedent favor expectation-disconfirmation interpretation.

##5. DISCUSSION: THE EXPECTATION-REALITY GAP

### 5.1. Theoretical Contributions

**1. Expectation-Disconfirmation in Digital Heritage Products**

Our findings extend Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation paradigm to emerging market e-commerce, demonstrating that in contexts with:
- Immature digital infrastructure
- Aggressive marketing outpacing operational capabilities
- Cultural products requiring specialized handling

...heightened expectations become liabilities rather than assets. This challenges Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assumptions that positive perceptions universally drive positive outcomes.

**2. The Dual Nature of Platform Characteristics**

Platform features operate through dual mechanisms:
- **Direct effects:** Usability and functionality
- **Expectation-setting effects:** Implicit promises

Interactive features, while appealing, create expectations for responsive communities—when undelivered, interactivity signals become disappointment triggers.

**3. Visual Engagement as "Honest Signal"**

Visual elements succeed because they function as **honest signals** (Spence, 1973): what consumers see in images closely matches physical products. Other features involve promises about future experiences, vulnerable to non-delivery.

### 5.2. Practical Implications

#### For E-commerce Platforms

**Priority 1: Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**
- Reduce marketing hyperbole around trust and convenience
- Set conservative expectations for delivery times, product variability
- Implement "realistic preview" features showing actual customer photos

**Priority 2: Invest in Visual Excellence**
- High-resolution, multi-angle photography
- Video demonstrations (actual products, not stock footage)
- 360° views and zoom functionality
- Augmented reality previews where feasible

**Priority 3: Match Interactivity Promises to Reality**
- If offering Q&A, ensure timely vendor responses
- Moderate and incentivize review generation
- Don't launch community features unless resourced for engagement

**De-prioritize:** Generic trust signals (badges, certifications) that create expectations platforms can't fulfill

#### For Traditional Product Vendors

**Segment-Specific Strategies:**

**Skeptical Browsers (28%)** – Lowest Loyalty, Acquisition Focus
- **Strategy:** Radical transparency
- **Tactics:**
  - Showcase production process videos
  - Highlight imperfections ("handmade uniqueness")
  - Offer unconditional returns
  - Use customer testimony over marketing claims

**Enthusiastic Shoppers (45%)** – Usability-Frustrated, Retention Focus
- **Strategy:** Frictionless experience
- **Tactics:**
  - Simplified checkout (minimize steps)
  - Proactive customer service
  - Navigation improvements (filters, guided discovery)
  - Loyalty programs rewarding patience

**Convenience Seekers (27%)** – Highest Loyalty (but still dissatisfied), Premium Focus
- **Strategy:** Operational excellence
- **Tactics:**
  - Guarantee fast shipping
  - VIP concierge service
  - Bulk purchasing options
  - Subscription models for repeat products

**Common Thread:** All strategies center on **managing expectations downward** while **delivering beyond promises**.

#### For Policymakers

**1. Truth-in-Advertising Enforcement**
- Regulate promises about delivery times, product authenticity
- Mandate disclosure of average response times for inquiries
- Penalize platforms for systematic over-promising

**2. Infrastructure Investment**
- Support logistics development for fragile traditional products
- Subsidize quality photography for artisan vendors
- Establish authentication services for heritage products

**3. Consumer Education**
- Campaigns on realistic e-commerce expectations
- Guidance on evaluating visual vs. textual claims
- Traditional product care and authenticity indicators

## 6. CONCLUSION

This study reveals a sobering reality for traditional Vietnamese product e-commerce: widespread consumer disappointment driven by systematic expectation-reality gaps. Contrary to conventional wisdom, higher trust, convenience perceptions, and enjoyment expectations correlate with **lower** loyalty (R² = .610, all coefficients negative), while only visual engagement demonstrates positive impact.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Universal Dissatisfaction:** Mean attitudinal loyalty (2.17/5) falls far below scale midpoint across all three consumer segments

2. **Expectation Gap Mechanism:** Psychological factors explain 61% of loyalty variance, but entirely through negative relationships—consumers who expect more are disappointed more

3. **Visual Honesty Wins:** Visual engagement (β = .398) emerges as sole consistent positive driver because it sets achievable expectations

4. **Interactivity Trap:** Greater platform interactivity correlates with **lower** loyalty (β = -.313), likely due to unfulfilled community engagement promises

5. **Segment Implications:** Even the "best" segment (Convenience Seekers, AL = 2.89) remains dissatisfied, indicating systemic rather than segment-specific problems

**Strategic Imperative:**

The Vietnamese traditional product e-commerce ecosystem must undergo fundamental recalibration:
- **Platforms:** Reduce promise-making, increase delivery capabilities
- **Vendors:** Embrace transparency over perfection
- **Policymakers:** Regulate expectation-setting and invest in enabling infrastructure

**Theoretical Contribution:**

This research demonstrates that in immature digital markets, the conventional positive relationships between platform quality perceptions and loyalty can invert when operational realities lag marketing promises. The expectation-disconfirmation paradigm proves more predictive than TAM in such contexts.

**Practical Contribution:**

We provide evidence-based rationale for counter-intuitive strategies: de-emphasizing trust-building rhetoric (which backfires) while investing in visual honesty (which succeeds).

**Final Reflection:**

The negative coefficients in our regression models,initially alarming, ultimately reveal a critical insight: **building loyalty requires first building realistic expectations**. For traditional Vietnamese products seeking digital success, the path forward lies not in amplifying promises but in honest representation and operational excellence.

## 7. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

### 7.1. Limitations

**1. Cross-Sectional Design**
- Cannot establish causal direction definitively
- Reverse causality possible (dissatisfaction → retrospective expectation inflation)
- Longitudinal tracking needed to confirm expectation → disappointment sequence

**2. Sampling Constraints**
- Convenience sampling limits generalizability
- Student-heavy sample (60% aged 18-24) may not represent older demographics
- Online distribution creates selection bias toward digitally engaged consumers

**3. Self-Report Measurement**

### Appendix B: Survey Questionnaire

**Attitudinal Loyalty Items (coding verification needed):**
1. I intend to continue shopping for traditional products on this platform
2. I would recommend this platform to friends for traditional products
3. This platform is my first choice for traditional Vietnamese products

**Scale:** 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree

**Note:** If items are reverse-coded in dataset, all interpretations would invert. Verification recommended.
